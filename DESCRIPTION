Description: This package is an implementation of the design of
    experiments-based interpolation technique (DoIt) for approximate Bayesian
    computations. The method uses evaluations of the unnormalised posterior density
    at a space-filling design of parameter values. Normalisation is achieved by
    approximating the posterior density by a weighted sum of Gaussian kernels. DoIt
    allows for approximate calculation of marginal posterior densities, and
    posterior expecations and variances. The package contains functions to
    optimally choose additional design points, and to calculate the optimal kernel
    bandwith by efficient cross validation.
